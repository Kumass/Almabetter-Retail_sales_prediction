Project Summary -
Rossmann is a well-known retail chain that operates drugstores and supermarkets in several countries, mostly in Europe. We have two csv file Rossmannstores data and store data that contain historical sales data. The data includes information about the store, such as Competitor’s Detail, Store type, Holiday’s, as well as number of the customers and sales transaction, such as the date, time, and amount of sale on each day. In this project we have done the following:

Analyzing the data for Null and Duplicate values and tackling them using

different techniques

Merging dataframes

Handling Outliers and correcting the data types

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Hypothesis Testing between Categorical and Numerical variables
Hypothesis Testing between Categorical and Numerical variables

Categorical Encoding

Feature Manipulation

Scaling the data using Standard Transform

Splitting the data

Training different models
At the end of this notebook, we have also presented our Conclusion
